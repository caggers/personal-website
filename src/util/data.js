        But day to day my skills in design, hardware, 3D printing and video editing come in handy for making rapid prototypes; 
        helpful for igniting the imaginations of the stakeholders and clients who visit. 
        I am a maker at heart who is happiest covered head to toe in glitter, paint and LEDs.
        The most important thing for me is to work with smart and creative people who inspire me. 
        I genuinely enjoy peer programming and code reviews as part of a healthy and happy team.
        A day in my perfect role would have lots of opportunities for collaboration with two way learning and teaching.  `,
